If goods shall be shipped, the secretary clarifies who will do the shipping.
If you have large amounts, special shipping will be necessary.
In these cases the secretary invites three logistic companies to make offers and she selects one of them.
In case of small amounts, normal post shipment is used.
Therefore a package label is written by the secretary and a parcel insurance taken by the logistics department head if necessary.
In the meantime the goods can be already packaged by the warehousemen.
If everything is ready, the packaged goods are prepared for being picked up by the logistic company.
