If an insurant could be possibly subrogated against, I get information about that.
I check that case and if the possibility is really there, I send a request for payment to the insurant and make me a reminder.
If recourse is not possible, I close the case.
When we receive the money, I make a booking and close the case.
If the insurant disagrees with the recourse, I’ll have to check the reasoning of that.
If he is right, I simply close the case. 
If he is wrong, I forward the case to a collection agency.
It the deadline for disagreement is reached and we haven’t received any money, I forward the case to the collection agency as well.
