The examination process can be summarised as follows. The process starts
when the female patient is examined by an outpatient physician, who decides
whether she is healthy or needs to undertake an additional examination. In the
former case, the physician fills out the examination form and the patient can
leave. In the latter case, an examination and follow-up treatment order is placed
by the physician who additionally fills out a request form. Beyond information
about the patient, the request form includes details about the examination 
requested and refers to a suitable lab. Furthermore, the outpatient physician
informs the patient about potential risks. If the patient signs an informed consent
and agrees to continue with the procedure, a delegate of the physician
arranges an appointment of the patient with one of the wards. The latter is
then responsible for taking a sample to be analysed in the lab later. Before the
appointment, the required examination and sampling is prepared by a nurse of
the ward based on the information provided by the outpatient section. Then, a
ward physician takes the sample requested. He further sends it to the lab indicated
in the request form and conducts the follow-up treatment of the patient.
After receiving the sample, a physician of the lab validates its state and decides
whether the sample can be used for analysis or whether it is contaminated and
a new sample is required. After the analysis is performed by a medical technical
assistant of the lab, a lab physician validates the results. Finally, a physician
from the outpatient department makes the diagnosis and prescribes the therapy
for the patient.
